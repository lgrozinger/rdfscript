# RDFScript

A scripting language for creating RDF graphs.

* Define, extend, and expand parameterisable templates for common patterns of RDF triples.
* Share your RDFScript templates with collaborators, or import their templates for use in your own script.
* Serialise as [turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [n3](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/), [rdf/xml](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), or easily extend RDFScript with a custom serialiser.
* Perform complex manipulations of the graph by hooking into Python code defined as extensions.

## Get Started

### Dependencies

RDFScript requires Python 3.x.

Python package dependencies are listed in `setup.py`.

### Install

1. Download or clone repository. `git clone https://github.com/lgrozinger/rdfscript.git`
2. Navigate to RDFScript directory. `cd rdfscript`
3. As a non-root user. `python setup.py install --user`

## Example usage

Running the example in `examples/templates.rdfsh`

`python run.py -s rdfxml examples/templates.rdfsh -o <output-file>`

Run the REPL

`python run.py -s rdfxml -o <output-file>`

Display command line options, including available serialisations.

`python run.py -h`

The example files in `examples/` are commented with some a explaination of the language.

## Contributing

### Extensions

Extensions provide a way to execute Python code to do additional, more complex processing of the RDF triples generated by templates.

Extensions intended as built-ins should be added to the `extensions` package. 'Third party' extensions can also be added at the command line, as long as they are in the Python PATH.

The interface to the extensions system will change soon, see https://github.com/lgrozinger/rdfscript/issues/27 and https://github.com/lgrozinger/rdfscript/issues/26 .

### Language

Please branch off of `dev` for feature development, or work directly on `dev` for bug-fixes.

### Testing

A test suite using the Python3 `unittest` package is under the `test/` directory.

Run the tests from the project root using `python -m unittest`
