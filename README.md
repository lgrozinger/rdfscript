# RDFScript

A scripting language for creating RDF graphs.

* Define, extend, and expand parameterisable templates for common patterns of RDF triples.
* Share your RDFScript templates with collaborators, or import their templates for use in your own script.
* Serialise as [turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [n3](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/), [rdf/xml](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), or easily extend RDFScript with a custom serialiser.
