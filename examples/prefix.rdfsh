# prefixes save typing when you want many URIs with the same ... prefix
@prefix p = <http://github.com/lgrozinger/#>

# now to produce the URI <http://github.com/lgrozinger/#uri>
p.uri
# is sufficient

# defaultPrefixes specify which prefix should be assumed if none is given
@prefix p

# now to produce the URI <http://github.com/lgrozinger/#uri>
uri
# is sufficient

# you can have many prefixes, but there is only ever one defaultPrefix
